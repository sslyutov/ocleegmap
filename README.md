graphical interface for fnirs configuration and monitoring data from fnirs channels.

main categories of UI elements. 
1. eeg map type such as 10x20, 10x10, 10x5
2. brain areas as Frontopolar, Frontal, ... FTT / TTP / CPP
3. actual potion of optode nodes (LEDs, DETs)
4. position of fnirs channels/pairs.

category brain area

| EEG Region Prefix |	Full Name	Primary Brain Area |	Typical Function / Notes |
|-------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Fp | Frontopolar  | Very front of frontal lobe	Decision making, attention |
| F	 | Frontal	    | Frontal lobe	Executive function, motor planning |
| AF | Anterior     | Frontal	Between Fp and F	Cognitive control, attention |
| FC | Fronto-Central |	Between F and C	Motor control, integration |
| C  | Central	Central | sulcus	Motor and somatosensory |
| CP | Centro-Parietal |	Between C and P	Sensory-motor integration |
| P	 | Parietal	Parietal | lobe	Spatial and sensory processing |
| PO | Parieto-Occipital |	Between P and O	Visual-spatial integration |
| O	 | Occipital	Occipital | lobe	Vision and visual processing |
| T	 | Temporal	Temporal | lobe	Auditory and language processing |
| FT |	Fronto-Temporal | 	Between F and T	Language and emotion integration |
| TP |	Temporo-Parietal |	Between T and P	Language comprehension, multisensory |
| FTT / TTP / CPP |	Extended 10–10 or 10–5 regions	| Intermediate points	Used for high-density arrays |
